## How to run:

```
# First get an activation code.
#   This can be run anywhere, and you should save the outputted activation ID and code
aws ssm create-activation --default-instance-name myName --iam-role $SSM_ECS_INSTANCE_ROLE --region us-west-2 --registration-limit 100

# Second run this script on instance:
sudo ./ecs-anywhere-install.sh --region us-west-2 --cluster $CLUSTER --activation-id "$ACTIVATION_ID" --activation-code "$ACTIVATION_CODE"
